# Challenge #2 - Naive receiver

There's a lending pool offering quite expensive flash loans of Ether, which has 1000 ETH in balance.

You also see that a user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance, capable of interacting with the lending pool and receiveing flash loans of ETH.

Drain all ETH funds from the user's contract. Doing it in a single transaction is a big plus ;) 

## Solution:

Force an arbitrary address to take a flashLoan and pay fees for it.
